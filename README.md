# Ecosystem
This is a personal project that simulates a closed ecosystem where each object represents a type of insect with its own unique movement and AI. The project is implemented in Java and uses various design patterns to ensure modularity and scalability.

# Project Overview
The goal of the project is to create a closed ecosystem where different types of insects coexist and interact with each other based on their AI behavior. The ecosystem consists of various objects such as plants, water bodies, predators, and prey. Each object in the ecosystem is represented by a Java class and has its own unique set of properties and behaviors.

The insects in the ecosystem move based on their movement behavior, which is defined in their respective classes. The movement behavior is implemented using various algorithms such as random walk, pathfinding, and flocking. The insects also have their own AI behavior that determines their actions based on their surroundings and goals. The AI behavior is implemented using decision trees, state machines, and other techniques.

# Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

src/main/java/com/example/ecosystem - contains the source code for the ecosystem simulation

Ecosystem.java - the main class that initializes and runs the ecosystem simulation

Insect.java - the base class for all insects in the ecosystem

Ant.java - a subclass of Insect that represents an ant

Bee.java - a subclass of Insect that represents a bee

Butterfly.java - a subclass of Insect that represents a butterfly

Predator.java - a subclass of Insect that represents a predator

Prey.java - a subclass of Insect that represents a prey

Plant.java - a class that represents a plant in the ecosystem

WaterBody.java - a class that represents a water body in the ecosystem

src/test/java/com/example/ecosystem - contains the unit tests for the ecosystem simulation
